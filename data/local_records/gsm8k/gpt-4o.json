So, his salary four years later is:\n   \\[\n   40,000 + (0.4 \\times 40,000) = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4**: Assume Lylah's salary increased at the same percentage rate (40% increase) over the same period.\n   Lylah's salary four years later is:\n   \\[\n   30,769.23 + (0.4 \\times 30,769.23) = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 5**: Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.\n   Adding their salaries:\n   \\[\n   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n#### 99076.92",

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, which means she also places 3 more bids in addition to her initial bid.\n  5. Thus, the total number of bids (including Carmen's winning bid) is:\n     - Initial bid (Carmen) = 1\n     - 3 bids by other people + 3 response bids by Carmen = 6\n     - Total = 1 (initial bid) + 6 (remaining bids) = 7 bids.\n  6. Since the bids increase by $50 each time, the bid amounts form an arithmetic sequence starting at $200 with a common difference of $50.\n  7. The 7th bid (Carmen's final bid) can be calculated as:\n     - Final bid = Initial bid + (number of bids - 1) × $50\n     - Final bid = $200 + (7 - 1) × $50\n     - Final bid = $200 + 6 × $50\n     - Final bid = $200 + $300 = $500.\n\n- Final line:\n#### 500",

Kenny uses $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, meaning he earns a total of $150.\n5. Set up the equation: \\( 1 \\cdot x = 150 \\).\n6.

Therefore, the rate is **1 lawn per 60 minutes** or \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) lawn/minute.\n   - Rabbit mode: He can mow the lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, the rate is **1 lawn per 40 minutes** or \\( \\frac{1}{40} \\) lawn/minute.\n\n2. Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode. To find the time taken in each mode:\n   - In turtle mode: Time = \\( \\text{Work} \\div \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 \\) minutes.\n   - In rabbit mode: Time = \\( \\text{Work} \\div \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{40} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20 \\) minutes.\n\n3.

Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \\( 2x \\) (since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).\n3. The price of each small stuffed animal is $4, so the total revenue from selling small stuffed animals is \\( 4 \\cdot 2x = 8x \\).\n4. The price of each large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\).\n5. The total revenue from selling large stuffed animals is \\( 12 \\cdot x \\).\n6. The total revenue from all sales is $120. Therefore, the equation representing the problem is:\n   \\[\n   8x + 12x = 120\n   \\]\n7. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   20x = 120\n   \\]\n8. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{120}{20} = 6\n   \\]\n9. Since \\( x = 6 \\), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \\( 2x = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n#### 12",

There is a **50% chance of having a substitute teacher**, in which case Marcus automatically won’t have to turn in his homework.  \nProbability of having the substitute = **0.5**. Probability of NOT having the substitute = **1 - 0.5 = 0.5**.\n\n2.

    "raw_response": "- Reasoning:  \n  To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we first calculate the total selling price of all watermelons since the vendor made a profit of 25%. Initially, the vendor spent $80 to buy the watermelons. A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.  \n  - Total selling price = 125% of $80 = \\( 1.25 \\times 80 = 100 \\).  \n  Each watermelon was sold for: Total selling price ÷ Number of watermelons = \\( 100 \\div 50 \\).    \n\n#### 2",

Since it takes Ana 3 minutes to peel one orange, she can peel \\( \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\) oranges in an hour.\n  2. Next, determine the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since it takes Jane 4 minutes to peel one orange, she can peel \\( \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\) oranges in an hour.\n  3. Subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: \\( 20 - 15 = 5 \\).\n  4. Thus, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.\n\n- Final line:\n#### 5",

Half of 12 is 6, meaning 6 toy soldiers will be sold for $5 each, and the remaining 6 toy soldiers will be sold for $7 each. To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we calculate:\n  - $5 × 6 = $30 for the first half of the collection.\n  - $7 × 6 = $42 for the second half of the collection.\n  - Adding these amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.\n\n#### 72",
