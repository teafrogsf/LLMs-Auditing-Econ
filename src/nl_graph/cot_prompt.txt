In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are:
an edge from node 1 to node 0 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 0 to node 2 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 2 to node 3 with capacity 4.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3?
A: 
<reason>
From the source (node 1), we can send 10 units of flow to node 0.
10 units of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 0 to node 2.
6 units of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 4 units of flow from node 2 to node 3.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 3 is 4. So the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3 is 4.

In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 3 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 0 to node 4 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 1 to node 3 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 1 to node 4 with capacity 5,
an edge from node 2 to node 1 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 3 to node 1 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 3 to node 4 with capacity 1,
an edge from node 4 to node 3 with capacity 2.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4?
A: 
<reason>
From the source (node 0), we can send 10 units of flow to node 4, and 3 units of flow to node 3.
3 units of flow arrive at node 3, then we can send 3 units of flow from node 3 to node 1.
3 units of flow arrive at node 1, then we can send 3 units of flow from node 1 to node 4.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 13. So the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4 is 13.

Q: What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4?
A: 
<reason>
From the source (node 0), we can send 10 units of flow to node 1, and 2 units of flow to node 2.
10 units of flow arrive at node 1, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 3 to node 1, and 4 units of flow from node 3 to node 2.
6 units of flow arrive at node 2, then we can send 5 units of flow from node 2 to node 4.
6 units of flow arrive at node 3, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 3 to node 4.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 11. So the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4 is 11.
